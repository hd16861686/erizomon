Monitor Licode Erizo errors and send alerts

# Usage
Simply set the time range, SMTP server, sender, and recipients in the file config/config.json and run the script.
Preferably this script will be run from cron on a regular schedule, e.g. every 10 minutes, and the time range in
the config file would match that.
